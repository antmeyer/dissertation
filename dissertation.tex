\begin{abstract}
This dissertation will present a novel approach to the 
unsupervised learning of morphology (ULM). 
My primary research objective is to demonstrate \emph{how} one can 
implement autosegmental morphological theory in a machine learning system.
Most previous work in ULM has treated concatenative and non-concatenative 
morphological processes as fundamentally different, 
e.g., by designing separate modules, one for concatenative morphology 
and one for non-concatenative.
I will show that a Multiple Cause Mixture Model (MCMM) 
can serve as a universal framework for ULM, i.e., one that handles concatenative 
and non-concatentive morphology in a unified way. 

My secondary research objectives address matters of implementation 
and thus support my primary objective.
The matters of feature-set design and the system's evaluation are especially important.
I am using exclusively word-internal features. That is, there will be no 
features referencing markings on adjacent words or any other property that transcends word boundaries.
Each feature vector (representing a word) is utterly void of morphosyntactic information.
Consequently, the MCMM has no means of learning traditional morphemes 
or morphosyntactic categories.
Instead, it learns \emph{morphs}, intermediate units that reside between 
phonology and morphosyntax. 
However, this requires us to evaluate morphs, even though we do not know 
beforehand what the morphs should be.
My final research objective is thus to devise a suitable evaluation method 
for a system that learns morphs.

% The abstract is double-spaced and limited to 350 words. As many people will learn about
%your work through your abstract published in Dissertation Abstracts (http://proquest.umi.com/login),
%you should spend a good bit of effort in the composition of both the abstract and the title of your work.
%Try to convey the flavor of your work, not just the bare bones of your findings; in an average abstract
%there will be about 70 characters per line with a maximum of 35 lines. You should also work to phrase your
%title so that it truly describes the contents and will be easily found in the index of Dissertation Abstracts.
%The index is based on key words, so be as specific as you can be about your subject \cite{saund:94}.
