\chapter{DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION}

My evaluation scripts have been proving very difficult to debug, but once they are ready, I will perform the full evaluation, which 
will inform a lot of what I say here. For the time being, however, the evidence yielded through manual inspection of the output shows that
MCMMs are quite capable of learning non-concatenative morphology. (See the cluster samples displayed in chapter~\ref{ch:results} as 
figures~\label{fig:cl-fem} and \label{fig:cl-hit}.
